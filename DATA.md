Agent mode
Tackle complex, multi-step tasks. Agent mode reads your codebase, suggests edits across files, runs terminal commands, and responds to compile or test failures — all in a loop until the job is done. Further refine agent mode to fit your team's workflows with VS Code extensions and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

Next edit suggestions
VS Code predicts your next move as you code. Use the Tab key to accept AI-powered suggestions right in your editor. It intelligently recommends what to change — and where — based on the edits you're already making.
