        <p>
          Tackle complex, multi-step tasks. Agent mode reads your codebase,
          suggests edits across files, runs terminal commands, and responds to
          compile or test failures â€” all in a loop until the job is done.
          Further refine agent mode to fit your team&apos;s workflows with VS
          Code extensions and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.
